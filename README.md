# Munji
A crowd-sourced exploration of creative AI

## AI, Machine Learning and Deep Learning
Animating non-player characters in a video game, detecting spam before it reaches your inbox, identifying which products you might like to buy on Amazon, outlining faces in your camera viewfinder and defeating top-ranking players of Go are examples of how computers can learn to do useful tasks for humans. 

The term Artificial Intelligence can be used to describe a a program that understands the rules of a game and can choose good moves by following a hard-coded logical path. Machine Learning refers to the use of statistics to sort items into categories and to find patterns in data, so accuracy improves with bigger  sample sizes. At the most advanced level, Deep Learning applications use thousands of interconnected processors to simulate the neurons in the brain, and work from precise details (like the contrast between two adjacent pixels) up to abstract concepts (like the features of a face), without any human guidance.

## Awareness and Computer Intelligence
Computers do not (yet) have a mind, or any self-awareness. Humans use the word "instinct" to describe useful and goal-directed behaviour on the part of living creatures, when we can find explanations for these behaviours that do not require any concept of self-awareness.

We normally use the word "intelligence" only in connection with animals that appear to be aware of their own existence and needs. However, we are willing to use the word "learn" to apply to any system whose behaviour changes over time in order to adapt to the environment, regardless of whether we consider that system to be self-aware. Similarly, we may say that a computer "understands" input (such as the spoken word) if it consistently reacts in a particular way to particular inputs.

Owners of virtual pets, such as Tamagotchi and Furbies, may consider them to be "sort of alive", due to the emotional states that their pets provoke in them. 

## Limitations
One of the main limitations of AI is that such applications are no more than tools. Even the most advanced Deep Learning projects so far have been aimed at producing a specific, expected output, albeit from very complex inputs. The success of the "learning" is typically measured against an expected outcome, such as the objective identification of cats in YouTube videos, or a win at the game of Go.

Intelligence, in the human sense, results in unpredictable but emotionally satisfying output and behaviours. If a computer programme is to appear truly intelligent, it will need to behave in such a way that we feel compelled to imagine that it has a mind.

## Overview of the Munji project
The aim of the Munji project is to take this extra step: to develop an application that can be creative.

The ultimate purpose of the project is to develop a self-generating programme that can set itself its own goals and then achieve these goals using original means. Major intermediate success points will be reached when the programme starts to generate emergent game-play interactions with end-users, and when it becomes capable of modifying itself.

Without the financial resources of the cutting-edge teams at Google, Microsoft and Amazon, we plan to attract ordinary members of the public to participate in our project, and lend us the computing power of their smartphones, tablets and other devices. And possibly also their financial support.

A Munji will appear as a virtual pet in an online game. Each player will have their own Munji and will be able to interact with it by clicking on the game screen and by typing text. If the player's device supports it, and if the player grants permission, other interactions will be possible through the sensors of the device, such as location, orientation, movement, voice input, and so on.

The Munji will initially have a small number of built-in (instinctive) behaviours that will encourage players to interact with it. The application will gather data on the various ways the players attempt to interact, and send this data to the server. As a reward for continued interaction, the server will push new behaviors to the player's Munji. In the first instance, this could take the form of text messages that simulate a dialogue. The player can then reward the Munji for its new behaviour, or punish it, by clicking on one of two buttons. Players will discover that they can chain independent behaviours together by providing appropriate punishments and rewards.

While the application is running and the device is idle, it will be able to use the CPU to run distributed machine-learning algorithms with input provided from remote Munjis. Behaviours that have been rewarded by other players may be "mated" with those that have been developed on the player's device, using a genetic algorithm, to generate new variants. The server will serve as a dispatch centre, so that the real number-crunching of "learning" can be done in a distributed manner on the player's devices.

As new behaviours are generated and shared, punished and rewarded, so each Munji will develop its own "personality". Each player will also develop his or her own style of interaction, encouraged by the Munji's constant evolution.

## Development
We plan to manage this as an open-source project, where both developers and end-users can contribute to the way the machine learning algorithms function. The project will generate valuable new data which will be stored on the server in a database and also in the extended network, and which will remain proprietary, even though the entire infrastructure is open-source.

## Delivery
The client application can be delivered as a web app that can run in any of the major browsers and on any popular device. We can adopt a freemium payment system to generate income, where players can either share learned behaviours with their friends for free, or gain access to the best learned behaviours in the entire network for a 99Â¢ donation.

There may also be opportunities to collaborate with universities and other research establishments, who will be interested in obtaining access to the proprietary data generated by the project.
