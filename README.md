# Munji
A crowd-sourced exploration of creative AI

## Overview
Munji is a virtual pet that learns to interact with you.

It evolves in a web application that can be opened in any modern browser on any current device. Each Munji begins life with a few basic "instinctive" behaviours, such as moving around the screen, changing colour, and emitting sounds. It listens for input on all channels available to it (keyboard, mouse, touch, GPS, accelerometer, ...) and you can reward or punish it for its reactions to this input by pressing on one of two buttons: Like and Dislike. You can thus encourage your Munji to learn new behaviours that will in turn encourage you to press the Like button.

These learned behaviours are not entirely stable. A genetic algorithm generates variations on each learned behaviour every time the Munji adopts it. Your use of the Like and Dislike buttons helps to determine which of these variants survive in the gene pool.

When a given learned behaviour consistently prompts you to reward it, it may be uploaded to the server to be shared with others. To reward you for persistent efforts in training your Munji, new behaviours learned from other trainers are periodically downloaded from the server. These new behaviours enrich the gene pool, and give you more opportunities for creativity.

As new behaviours are generated and shared, punished and rewarded, so each Munji will develop its own "personality". Each player will also develop his or her own style of interaction, encouraged by the Munji's constant evolution.
